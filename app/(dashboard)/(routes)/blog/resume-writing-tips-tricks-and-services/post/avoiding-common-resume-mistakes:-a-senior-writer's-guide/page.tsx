        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Introduction</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Crafting a resume is like cooking a gourmet dish; you need to get all the ingredients just right. In this post, we peel away the layers of common resume mistakes, helping you become a master chef in the kitchen of job applications.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Overloading with Information</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          A resume is not a place for your entire life story. Too many job seekers fall into the trap of overloading their resumes with irrelevant details. Follow the rule of thumb: less is more. Focus on the most impactful experiences, those that demonstrate your capabilities and value to potential employers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Ignoring Keywords</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Keywords are the secret sauce to getting your resume past the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used by many companies. Tailor your resume by incorporating industry-specific terminology, making it more likely to catch the automated eye and impress human hiring managers alike.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Neglecting Action Verbs</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Do not just list your job dutiesâ€”make them sing! Use strong action verbs to highlight your achievements. Words like "spearheaded," "orchestrated," and "optimized" can power up your resume and show that you are someone who makes things happen.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Neglecting to Quantify Achievements</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Numbers will back up your claims and provide a clearer picture of your impact. For example, instead of saying you "increased sales," you might state you "boosted sales by 30 percent in Q1 2022." Specifics make your achievements more credible and impressive.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Examples of Revamped Resumes</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
