        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Introduction</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Bullet points: they are the unsung heroes of your resume, simultaneously the most straightforward and most facilely overlooked. Let us embark on a journey to morph these pedestrian markers into eloquent bursts of professional prowess.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Why Focus on Bullet Points?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Bullet points are not just placeholders; they are potent snippets of your professional narrative. A well-crafted bullet point can lasso a hiring manager's attention faster than you can say "curriculum vitae." With the right phrasing, every bullet can become a dynamic story about your qualifications.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Tips for Crafting Compelling Bullet Points</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Action-Oriented Language:</strong> Start each bullet point with powerful action verbs that convey responsibility and dynamism. Think "spearheaded," "orchestrated," or "transformed."</li>
          <li><strong>Quantify Achievements:</strong> Numbers resonate. Do not merely state that you managed a team; specify that you led a team of 10 to increase productivity by 30%.</li>
          <li><strong>Tailor to the Job Description:</strong> Reflect on the role you seek and mirror the language and requirements in the bullet points. Thus, ensure they serve as a spotlight on your most relevant experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>Show Real Impact:</strong> Go beyond tasks and denote the actual impact of your work. If you implemented a new system, elucidate how it improved efficiency or cut costs.</li>
        </ul>
