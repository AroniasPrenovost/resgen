       <p className="text-gray-700 custom_html">
         Your resume summary is your elevator pitch. It should be concise, engaging, and tailored to the job you are applying for.

       <p className="text-gray-700 custom_html">
         Your skills section should be a snapshot of your abilities. Include both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (interpersonal abilities). Make sure to align your skills with the job requirements. This section is crucial for passing through ATS and catching the eye of hiring managers.

       <p className="text-gray-700 custom_html">
         Your education section should include your degrees, certifications, and any relevant coursework. If you are a recent graduate, place this section near the top of your resume, but not before any relevant coursework or projets applicable to the job you are applying to.
