       <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Introduction</h2>
       <p className="text-gray-700 custom_html">
         Welcome to 2024, where the job market is more competitive than ever. Whether you are a new grad, a seasoned professional, or someone looking to make a career change, your resume is your ticket to landing that dream job. But how do you make your application shine? Let us dive into some fresh strategies to give your resume a reboot.
       </p>

       <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Tailor Your Resume for Each Job</h2>
       <p className="text-gray-700 custom_html">
         One size does not fit all when it comes to resumes. Tailoring your resume for each job application is crucial. Start by carefully reading the job description and highlighting the key skills and experiences the employer is looking for. Then, customize your resume to reflect those qualifications. This shows that you have taken the time to understand the role and are genuinely interested in the position.

       <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Showcase Your Achievements</h2>
       <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
         <li className="custom_html"><strong>Quantify Your Successes:</strong> Use numbers to highlight your achievements. For example, "Increased sales by 20% in six months."</li>
         <li className="custom_html"><strong>Use Action Verbs:</strong> Start your bullet points with strong action verbs like "led," "developed," or "implemented."</li>
         <li className="custom_html"><strong>Include Relevant Projects:</strong> Showcase projects that are relevant to the job you are applying for. This can include coursework, internships, or volunteer work.</li>
         <li className="custom_html"><strong>Highlight Soft Skills:</strong> Do not forget to mention soft skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. These are highly valued by employers.</li>
         <li className="custom_html"><strong>Keep It Concise:</strong> Aim for a one-page resume if you are a new grad or have less than ten years of experience. For more experienced professionals, two pages are acceptable.</li>
       </ul>

       <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Optimize for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)</h2>
       <p className="text-gray-700 custom_html">
         Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes before they reach a human recruiter. To ensure your resume gets past the ATS, use keywords from the job description, avoid using images or graphics, and stick to a clean, simple format. This increases the chances of your resume being seen by a hiring manager.

       <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-700 pl-4 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
         <p><strong>Use Standard Headings:</strong> Stick to common headings like "Experience," "Education," and "Skills."</p>
         <p><strong>Avoid Fancy Fonts:</strong> Use standard fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri.</p>
         <p><strong>Save as a PDF:</strong> Save your resume as a PDF to ensure the formatting stays intact.</p>
         <p><strong>Include Contact Information:</strong> Make sure your phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile are easy to find.</p>
       </div>

       <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Leverage Your Network</h2>
       <p className="text-gray-700 custom_html">
         Networking is a powerful tool in your job search. Reach out to your connections on LinkedIn, attend industry events, and join professional groups. A referral from someone within the company can significantly boost your chances of getting an interview. Do not be afraid to ask for informational interviews to learn more about the company and its culture.

       <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-700 pl-4 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
         <p className="custom_html"><strong>Join Alumni Networks:</strong> Connect with alumni from your school who are working in your desired field.</p>
         <p className="custom_html"><strong>Attend Job Fairs:</strong> Job fairs are a great way to meet recruiters and learn about job openings.</p>
       </div>
